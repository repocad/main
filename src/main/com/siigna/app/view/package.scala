/**
 * The <i>view</i> package defines all the drawing functionality for Siigna.
 *
 * <br>
 * The package defines various traits for interacting with the graphical engine beneath Siigna. We have tried to
 * allow you to extend the functionality if you require a different setup than we provide. Both the
 * [[com.siigna.app.view.Graphics]] and [[com.siigna.app.view.Renderer]] traits provides interfaces that can be
 * implemented in different ways than we do - our take at implementing the default graphics mechanisms lies
 * in the [[com.siigna.app.view.siigna]] package.
