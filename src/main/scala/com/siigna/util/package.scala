/**
 * The <i>util</i> package contains auxillary functionality to Siigna. The collection package contains classes
 * regarding attributes and other collection-based implementations. The event package contains classes representing
 * user-events and event-handling such as the [[com.siigna.util.event.EventParser]] and [[com.siigna.util.event.Snap]]
 * and [[com.siigna.util.event.Track]]. The geom package contains geometries and methods to calculate on and manipulate
 * geometric objects. The persistence package is used to marshal and unmarshal objects and write to or read from a
 * file. In restricted environments (such as an applet) it is necessary to use these utility methods, because
 * third-party code (such as modules) are not allowed to perform any I/O operations.
