/**
 * The <i>util</i> package contains auxiliary functionality to Siigna.
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     The collection package contains classes regarding attributes and other collection-based implementations.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     The event package contains classes representing user-events and event-handling such as the
 *     [[com.siigna.util.event.EventParser]] and [[com.siigna.util.event.Snap]] and [[com.siigna.util.event.Track]].
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     The geom package contains geometries and methods to calculate on and manipulate geometric objects. The
 *     persistence package is used to marshal and un-marshal objects and write to or read from a file. In restricted
 *     environments (such as an applet) it is necessary to use these utility methods, because third-party code
 *     (such as modules) are not allowed to perform any I/O operations.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
