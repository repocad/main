  SIIGNA MAINLINE
  the mainline of Siigna is the core of the software. It generates the application window, creates the ability to draw, and send messages.
  on top of mainline lies the MODULES, which contain specific drawing tools.
  The mainline facilitates a system for sending commands via messages, allowing entire drawings of parts of drawings to be send dynamically 
  and viewed on other instances of Siigna in real time.

  ABOUT SIIGNA
  Siigna is an online open-source 2d CAD application that runs online on the JAVA platform.
  it is intended to suit the needs of different groups. Therefore the backbone of Siigna, the mainline, is relatively small and a majority of functionality 
  is branched out into modules. The idea is that Siigna can be loaded with different sets of modules, creating different modes for generating
  different types of artwork.
