  SIIGNA MAINLINE
  The mainline of Siigna is the core of the software. It generates the application
  window, creates the ability to draw and communicate with the server. On top of
  the mainline lies the MODULES, which contain specific drawing tools. The mainline
  facilitates a system for sending commands via messages, allowing entire drawings
  of parts of drawings to be send dynamically and viewed on other instances of
  Siigna in real time.

  ABOUT SIIGNA
  Siigna is an online open-source 2-dimensional CAD application that runs online on
  the JAVA virtual machine. It is intended to suit the needs of different groups.
  Therefore the backbone of Siigna, the mainline, is relatively small and a majority
  of functionality is branched out into modules. The idea is that Siigna can be
  loaded with different sets of modules, creating different modes for generating
  different types of artwork.
